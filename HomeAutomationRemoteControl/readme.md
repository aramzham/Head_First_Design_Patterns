<p><h2>Facade :office:</h2><i>Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.</i></p>
<h3>Bullet points :european_castle:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When you need to simplify and unify a large interface or complex set of interfaces, use a facade.</li>
  <li>A facade decouples a client from a complex subsystem.</li>
  <li>Implementing a facade requires that we compose the facade with its subsystem and use delegation to perform the work of the facade. </li>
  <li>You can implement more than one facade for a subsystem.</li>
  <li>An adapter wraps an object to change its interface, a decorator wraps an object to add new behaviors and responsibilities, and a facade “wraps” a set of objects to simplify.
</li>
</ul>
