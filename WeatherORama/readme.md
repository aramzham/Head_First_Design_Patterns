<p><h2>Observer 👓</h2><i>Defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.</i></p>
<h3>Bullet points 🕵️</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Subjects, or as we also know
them, Observables, update
Observers using a common
interface.</li>
  <li>You can push or pull data from
the Observable when using
the pattern (pull is considered
more “correct”).</li>
  <li>Don’t depend on a specific
order of notification for your
Observers.</li>
  <li>Observers are loosely coupled
in that the Observable knows
nothing about them, other
than that they implement the
Observer Interface.</li>
</ul>
