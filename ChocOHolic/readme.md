<h2>Singleton</h2> :heavy_check_mark: - <i>Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it.<i/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>When you need to ensure you only have one instance of a class running around your application, turn to the Singleton</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Bullet points<b/> :gun:
<ul>
  <li>The Singleton Pattern ensures you have at most one instance of a class in your application.</li>
  <li>The Singleton Pattern also provides a global access point to that instance. </li>
  <li>Examine your performance and resource constraints and carefully choose an appropriate Singleton implementation for  multithreaded applications (and we should consider all applications multithreaded!).</li>
</ul>
