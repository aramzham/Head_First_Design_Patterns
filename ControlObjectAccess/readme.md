<h2>Proxy :fast_forward:</h2>
<i>Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.</i>
<h3>Bullet points :ticket:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Proxy Pattern provides
a representative for another
object in order to control the
clientâ€™s access to it. There
are a number of ways it can
manage that access.</li>
  <li>A Remote Proxy manages
interaction between a client
and a remote object.</li>
  <li>A Virtual Proxy controls access
to an object that is expensive
to instantiate.</li>
  <li>A Protection Proxy controls
access to the methods of an
object based on the caller.</li>
  <li>Many other variants of
the Proxy Pattern exist
including caching proxies,
synchronization proxies,
firewall proxies, copy-on-write
proxies, and so on.</li>
</ul>
