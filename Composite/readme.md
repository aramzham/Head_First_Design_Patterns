<h2>Composite :evergreen_tree:</h2>
<i>Allows you to
compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite
lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.</i>
<h3>Bullet points :mango:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Composite Pattern
provides a structure to hold
both individual objects and
composites.</li>
  <li>The Composite Pattern allows
clients to treat composites and
individual objects uniformly.</li>
  <li>A Component is any object
in a Composite structure.
Components may be other
composites or leaf nodes.</li>
  <li>There are many design
tradeoffs in implementing
Composite. You need to
balance transparency and
safety with your needs.</li>
</ul>
