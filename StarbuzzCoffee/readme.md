<p><h2>Decorator :heart_decoration:</h2><i>Attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality</i></p>
<h3>Bullet points :selfie:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inheritance is one form of
extension, but not necessarily
the best way to achieve flexibility
in our designs.</li>
  <li>The Decorator Pattern provides
an alternative to subclassing for
extending behavior</li>
  <li>Decorator classes mirror the
type of the components they
decorate. (In fact, they are the
same type as the components
they decorate, either through
inheritance or interface
implementation.)</li>
  <li>Decorators change the behavior
of their components by adding
new functionality before and/or
after (or even in place of) method
calls to the component</li>
  <li>You can wrap a component with
any number of decorators.</li>
</ul>
