<p><h2>State 🗽</h2><i>Is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.</i></p>
<h3>Bullet points 🦩</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The State Pattern allows an
object to have many different
behaviors that are based on its
internal state.</li>
  <li>Unlike a procedural state
machine, the State Pattern
represents state as a full-blown
class.</li>
  <li>The Context gets its behavior
by delegating to the current
state object it is composed
with.</li>
  <li>The State and Strategy
Patterns have the same class
diagram, but they differ in
intent
  <ul>
    <li>Strategy Pattern typically
configures Context classes
with a behavior or algorithm.</li>
    <li>State Pattern allows a Context
to change its behavior as the
state of the Context changes.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>By encapsulating each state
into a class, we localize any
changes that will need to be
made.</li>
</ul>
