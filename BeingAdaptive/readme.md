<p><h2>Adapter</h2> - :electric_plug: <i>Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interface</i></p>
<h3>Bullet points :wine_glass:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When you need to use an existing class and its interface is not the one you need, use an adapter.</li>
  <li>An adapter changes an interface into one a client expects.</li>
  <li>Implementing an adapter may require little work or a great deal of work depending on the size and complexity of the target interface.</li>
  <li>There are two forms of the Adapter Pattern: object and class adapters.  Class adapters require multiple inheritance (not supported in C#).</li>
  <li>An adapter wraps an object to change its interface, a decorator wraps an object to add new behaviors and responsibilities, and a facade “wraps” a set of objects to simplify.
</li>
</ul>
